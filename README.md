# Welcome, fellow traveler
## whoami
My name is Lars Scheibling and I'm a software developer/DevOps Engineer. 
I currently live in Sweden, and spend my free time messing around with OpenSSH Certificates and other small projects. 
You'll find some of my projects under my organization [ScheiblingCo](https://github.com/scheiblingco), that's mostly because I really like codespaces and can't seem to use them on my personal projects yet.

You can find my blog [here](https://scheibling.se/category/blog/), there's some deep-dives into the technology behind SSH Certificates at the moment but there is more to come.
I also own [ssosh.io](https://docs.ssosh.io), it's not finished quite yet but I'm starting to get the hang of those pesky certificates.

I usually publish all of my software under GPLv3, meaning you're free to use all of my software commercially and non-commercially, you can modify and distribute it
but i'd appreciate if you included a link to the repo you borrowed code from, and maybe sent a PR if you've improved it in some way.
If you wanna use it commercially or distribute it under a different license, I'd be happy to talk to you about it and we might be able to come to a solution. 
I'll probably want some contribution to the codebase of the project you're going to be using in return though.
